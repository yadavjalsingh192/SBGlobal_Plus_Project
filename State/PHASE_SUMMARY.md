# PHASE_SUMMARY — SBGlobal Plus
**Updated:** 2026-09-19

Current Development checkpoint is `DEV-COMMERCIAL-WRITER-BOUNDARY-001`. Verified first-party runtime still has **180 Core + 44 PostgreSQL PASS**, while the database now has **43 migrations / 37 verification files PASS**. DD-063 physically catalogs the internal Commercial transition/recompile events and DD-064 removes broad application Commercial DML in favor of a dedicated no-bypass transition/compiler role with same-Tenant cross-Industry compiler reads and sibling-Tenant isolation. Verified executable `b420e1547d9366f3c21612643e2ee04c3214c992` / tree `80fdbb7377247f374801791f09ae75d118ae832b`. Next is the bounded atomic Commercial publication transaction floor; public changePlan binding remains blocked by missing physical DD-062 assessment/resolution evidence and Billing/approval producer runtime.

The sections below are chronological history of earlier gates and retain their original scope and evidence. Their former next-action and authorization statements are superseded by the current checkpoint.

1. Starting audited HEAD was `029faa5add582f6cfbf1688a145bf06dac6d5b34`; certification gates were first reopened rather than trusted.
2. 372 source-heading rows are preserved as parent inventory, not atomic proof.
3. Requirement-level evidence now contains **2,962 child rows: 2,555 VERIFIED, 0 GAP, 396 DEFERRED, 11 SUPERSEDED**.
4. Demonstrated S2.2 §9 SaaS Website source-loss was restored in F-06.
5. All **41 Management Systems** were independently recalculated and now have specific substantive owners; all nine industries pass equal evidence discipline.
6. General Architecture now enforces Tenant + Industry Context across API/data/storage/events/webhooks/offline/AI, matching the previously stronger A-07 isolation model.
7. One canonical effective-access chain, one A-08 four-surface model and one Core IdentityPort are active.
8. ADR-001…ADR-018 satisfy the Architecture decision evidence standard.
9. Fresh Foundation No-Loss/adversarial audit: PASS.
10. Fresh Architecture traceability, isolation attack, No-Loss and final adversarial audits: PASS.
11. **FOUNDATION CERTIFIED.**
12. **ARCHITECTURE CERTIFIED.**
13. **READY FOR DETAILED DESIGN.**
14. No application code, migrations, UI implementation, deployment scripts, backup ZIP or `main` merge was produced.

- `CLOSURE-BACKUP-01` closed by user direction without claiming a ZIP was created.
- All substantive pre-development gates remain PASS.
- **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT — SUPPORTED.**
- Development will continue on `docs/architecture-branch-2`; `main` remains unchanged by this continuation.

## All-Stages Current-State Audit — 2026-09-13

- Execution Start HEAD: `5d779b5ff9f2cce361ce81f2901ac95edfd697cc`; prompt blob: `5a44cc555c52c49632e0788ba5d4995559830a3e`; main: `3911590ff2020993ce51b32d7b091efd6f5f466f`.
- Every execution-start repository blob was fetched/read and its Git object identity/tree was independently reconstructed; `RawSourceCorpus` blobs remained immutable.
- Historical CI run `34736717516` is real successful evidence for `0001`–`0028`, but its assertions were not sufficient to support the broader security/completion claims.
- Material findings include missing Tenant/identity RLS, broad/default privileges, mutable ownership selectors, UUID-only cross-scope relationships, loose event/webhook scope, missing physical operator/PromptSet/ToolSet/provenance contracts and stale state wording.
- First correction commit: `1c4033ca0af3501099a014f9a34d0bad3c21c7dd`; migration/test failures were recorded and corrected, then the exact-head complete PostgreSQL suite passed. PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

- Source-owner projection audit corrected unrelated AI mappings and preserved every source child ID/text.
- Platform definitions and child bindings require Control Plane mutation authority in addition to scope; migration/verification 0032 passed.
- Next governed action: Continue Development with the DD-02/DD-03 identity and Tenant/Industry context service slice, then DD-04/DD-06 guard integration; retain database CI and the no-main-merge restriction.

## Core PostgreSQL checkpoint — 2026-09-14

Fresh consistency baseline `ea24fa631835c6b65d5ee2b4d8dcc656a2f0cee5` was reconciled through DD-040 / DEV-CORE-MAP-001. Lifecycle, membership/org, restriction and route/scope defects were corrected before the independent pooled PostgreSQL driver prerequisite. Two real-CI fixture failures were fixed without weakening schema invariants.

Executable `0ada4283959ea4abe39a0980574e2dfdcb62e508`: Core run `34823407649` passed 40 Core tests and 7 real PostgreSQL tests; Database run `34823407538` passed all 32 migrations / 26 verification files. The exact tested branch commit/tree appear in each job log. [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md) owns evidence and scope limits; [DEV-CORE-MAP-001](../Development/CORE_PERSISTENCE_ADAPTER_MAP.md) owns the remaining permission/catalog contracts. RawSource and main are unchanged; PR #2 remains draft/review only.

## Core platform-scope checkpoint — 2026-09-17

Executable `3e7b2927839d289240eb389902563f5ab3d68074`: Core Service Verify `35139097825` PASS (47 Core/server acceptance tests present; 11/11 real PostgreSQL tests) and Database Verify `35139097903` PASS (34 migrations / 28 verification files). DD-041/DD-042 read bindings remain closed and DD-043 now fails closed across RequestContext, persisted API credentials and RequestScopedSql. Checkpoint: `DEV-CORE-PLATFORM-SCOPE-001`. Historical next work at that checkpoint was concrete provider/session-security → PDP/ABAC → Commercial validation integration → DD-06 transports.

## Clerk session-security + PLATFORM_GLOBAL Authorization persistence checkpoint — 2026-09-17

DD-044 concrete Clerk identity/session-security integration was completed before the Authorization continuation. The first `DEV-AUTHZ-PDP-001` persistence commit (`c4ceff50d76730ef18232d448523ff5d1e896cd4`) failed exact-head database regression and was not promoted. `07d7a760e547d1c07618e4fe0bf95d6588fe2836` corrected the RLS registry vocabulary but exposed a schema-local deferred-FK verification defect. Verified executable `54e6fd0972699e31c4650e54faa9e41086f55755` corrected both without weakening Tenant/Industry RLS: Core Service Verify `35242938042` PASS (**65 Core/server + 13 PostgreSQL tests**) and Database Verify `35242938026` PASS (**35 migrations / 29 verification files**).

At that checkpoint, PLATFORM_GLOBAL role assignment plus immutable compiled-permission subject/snapshot persistence was present with FORCE RLS and least privilege; PDP/ABAC evaluator and compiler were not claimed. The governed next work from that historical checkpoint was to lock deterministic executable **permission-set v1 + ABAC expression v1 grammar** before any reader/evaluator implementation.

## Deterministic Authorization policy grammar checkpoint — 2026-09-17

Verified executable `1b0f90dc900e0ab49cde2f8305f11cfadadae31c`, tree `a48a2b8cd4d9447522ca2c5721d23a85175dbfa8`: Core Service Verify `35247193977` PASS (**71/71 Core/server + 13/13 real PostgreSQL tests**) and Database Verify `35247193986` PASS (**35 migrations / 29 verification files**).

Current checkpoint: **`DEV-AUTHZ-POLICY-GRAMMAR-001`**. Permission Set v1 and ABAC Expression v1 are now deterministic, schema-version-aligned, bounded and data-only. Unknown versions/fields/operators/attributes fail closed; no arbitrary JavaScript/eval, SQL, shell, regex/glob AST, template, network/filesystem/provider execution or dynamic object traversal is an executable policy surface. No database migration or Industry scope was changed by this slice.

Next governed work is **Authorization read store only**: exact tenant/platform CURRENT compiled snapshots plus applicable ACTIVE ABAC policies, validated through the locked v1 parsers with fail-closed scope/version/payload/dependency semantics. PDP/ABAC evaluation, compiler publication, Commercial integration and DD-06 transports remain later slices.


## Authorization read-store checkpoint — 2026-09-18

Verified executable `4916b30359cea056a352245176dcb33f739fc0a0`, tree `16e1a322620de4a0591222356e6db3dd5f0428bf`: Core Service Verify `35252274497` PASS (**75/75 Core/server + 15/15 real PostgreSQL tests**) and Database Verify `35252274557` PASS (**36 migrations / 30 verification files**).

Current checkpoint: **`DEV-AUTHZ-READ-STORE-001`**. Tenant and PLATFORM_GLOBAL Authorization snapshot paths are physically separate; only exact CURRENT snapshots and ACTIVE/effective-window ABAC policies are read. Persisted Permission Set v1, ABAC Expression v1 and permission-pattern data are validated through the locked grammar. Missing snapshots, unsupported versions, malformed payloads, scope mismatches, sibling-Industry leakage and persistence/dependency errors fail closed. The reader does not evaluate decisions or publish compiled state.

Next governed work is the **fail-closed `AuthorizationDecisionPort` PDP/ABAC evaluator + DD-17 AUTH acceptance only**. Compiler publication, Commercial integration and DD-06 transports remain later slices.


## Fail-closed Authorization evaluator checkpoint — 2026-09-18

DD-045 first closed a blocking ambiguity: persisted ABAC `RESTRICT` has no governed restriction payload/reducer, so bare RESTRICT cannot safely become allow-like. The bounded evaluator therefore fail-closes matching RESTRICT as `DENY / ABAC_DENY` until a separate restriction contract exists.

The first implementation `80fa65502fbe682963405e9cc01c47cdf800381d` failed exact-head Core/PostgreSQL TypeScript compilation (TS2322 resource narrowing) and was not promoted. Corrected executable `96b051ca6feef26d3f8534ce6d3240f6843dc31e`, tree `1e9d6151cc4fa01232b4ee1e7397a33fa81249b0`, passed Core Service Verify `35281558425` (**87/87 Core/server + 15/15 real PostgreSQL**) and Database Verify `35281558472` (**36 migrations / 30 verification files**).

Current checkpoint: **`DEV-AUTHZ-EVAL-001`**. Exact-current RBAC, fail-closed ABAC, stale-context detection, resource-policy deferral/fresh resource-stage read, server-owned supplemental-fact validation and non-disclosing dependency normalization are implemented/tested within this floor.

Next governed work: **dedicated Authorization compiler write boundary only** under DD-041 monotonic publication/invalidation and least-privilege tenant/platform writer separation.


## Authorization compiler publication checkpoint — 2026-09-18

Migration `0037_authorization_compiler_write_boundary.sql` introduced a dedicated `sbg_authorization_compiler_rw` NOLOGIN/NOBYPASSRLS role with SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE only on compiled tenant/platform subject/snapshot truth. Runtime app and Control Plane roles remain non-compiler writers; compiler has no DELETE or role/permission/ABAC source mutation authority.

Verified executable `2c9157e3a1ed30f18f8014e1b04aa799f2d73d15`, tree `a1cc883564516222ed6095e692ba6bd1ec33baac`, passed Core Service Verify `35282382158` (**95/95 Core/server + 18/18 real PostgreSQL**) and Database Verify `35282382162` (**37 migrations / 31 verification files**).

Current checkpoint: **`DEV-AUTHZ-COMPILER-001`**. Publication uses exact SERVICE scope, v1 validation, subject locking, CURRENT→SUPERSEDED transition, monotonically increasing pointer/version, invalidation without version reuse/decrement, and separate Tenant/Industry versus PLATFORM_GLOBAL paths.

Next governed work: **Commercial current-state integration only**.
