# SBGlobal Plus — PROJECT FOUNDATION
**Document ID:** F-00 · **Version:** 1.1 (Forensic Correction) · **Status:** IN PROGRESS — CERTIFICATION REVOKED (see §10; §9 retained as historical record) · **Date:** 01-09-2026
**Governed by:** MASTER_INSTRUCTION v2.5 (governing) + MASTER_PROMPT v2.5 · **Sources:** Raw Source Corpus S1 (Disorganized Data 1.md, Final v1.1) + S2.1–S2.9 (Disorganized Data 2.md) — immutable, preserved unmodified.

---

## 1. Primary Vision (Absolute Highest Authority)

> **"SBGlobal Plus is an AI-Ready, AI-Extensible, AI-Powered, Enterprise-Grade, Multi-Tenant, Multi-Industry SaaS Platform."**

Canonical ACTIVE primary tagline (USER-DIRECTED, CR-02 closed): **"One Intelligent Platform. Every Industry. Infinite Possibilities."** Historical/alternative taglines preserved: "Guided by Trust. Built for Tomorrow." (S1 §12.1) · "AI-Powered Enterprise Intelligence. One Core. Unlimited Possibilities." (S2.7).

## 2. Authority Hierarchy (applied to every statement in this package)

1. Primary Vision → 2. Explicit user direction → 3. MASTER_INSTRUCTION v2.5 + MASTER_PROMPT v2.5 (MI governs on difference) → 4. Raw Source Corpus as knowledge (Tier 1 S2.1 · Tier 2 S2.2 · Tier 3 S1 · Tier 4 S2.3–S2.8 · Tier 5 S2.9) → 5. Recorded decisions (D-DECISIONS) → 6. Approved architecture principles.

No raw source statement automatically becomes ACTIVE architecture; pipeline is **RAW CORPUS → classify → reconcile → architect → normalize → document → canonical model**.

## 3. Foundation Package Map (canonical document set, this build)

| ID | File | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| F-00 | F-00_FOUNDATION_OVERVIEW.md | Vision, authority, package map, status ledger, gap analysis |
| F-01 | F-01_PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md | Canonical business model, platform actors, application surfaces, tenancy, subscription/billing/licensing/entitlements, configuration platform, Core capability catalog |
| F-02 | F-02_END_TO_END_WORKFLOW.md | Visitor→Operations lifecycle: actors, triggers, inputs, outputs, rules, authorization, states, audit per step |
| F-03 | F-03_IDENTITY_SECURITY.md | Core Identity & Access, RBAC+ABAC, validation chain, tenant isolation, security & compliance framework, risk/residency |
| F-04 | F-04_DATA_FOUNDATION.md | Master/Reference/Tenant/Industry-context/Transaction/Configuration/Audit/AI/Seed/Demo/Media data — ownership, lifecycle, tenancy, governance |
| F-05 | F-05_AI_FOUNDATION.md | AI platform layers, providers, assistants/agents/skills/tools, knowledge/RAG, workflows, routing, governance |
| F-06 | F-06_EXPERIENCE_LAYER.md | Public SaaS website, Platform App, Tenant Management App, Industry Experiences (web/mobile/desktop), 3-layer instance model, UI/UX layer model |
| F-07 | F-07_INDUSTRIES_1-3.md | Healthcare & Diagnostics · Education · eCommerce/Retail & Commerce |
| F-08 | F-08_INDUSTRIES_4-6.md | Hospitality · Manufacturing · Professional Services |
| F-09 | F-09_INDUSTRIES_7-9.md | Government & Public Sector · NGO/Temple/Trust · Security & Facility Management |

Registers (../Registers/): SOURCE_REGISTRY · D-INDEX · D-DECISIONS · D-CHANGELOG · D-CHECKPOINT · TRACEABILITY_MATRIX · NO_LOSS_AUDIT · REVIEW_REQUIRED. State (../State/): PROJECT_STATE.md · PHASE_SUMMARY.md · HANDOFF_NOTE.md · PROJECT_MANIFEST.json. Backup metadata: BACKUP_METADATA.json.

Non-duplication rule: each fact lives in exactly one document above; every other document cross-references it (`→ F-xx §y`).

## 4. Classification & Labelling (used throughout)

Every material knowledge unit carries: **one Primary Scope** (Platform-wide Core → Tenant-wide → Industry-wide → Module-specific → Tenant-specific → User/Role-specific), zero+ Applicable Contexts, and **one provenance label**: `[SD]` SOURCE-DERIVED · `[PR]` PLATFORM-REUSABLE · `[UD]` USER-DIRECTED · `[AC]` ARCHITECTURAL-COMPLETION (labelled, never presented as source) · `[RR]` REVIEW_REQUIRED.

## 5. Canonical Business Model (ACTIVE — cross-ref F-01 §1)

```
CORE PLATFORM → INDUSTRY VERTICAL CATALOG/SUITES → TENANT → PRIMARY INDUSTRY
→ OPTIONAL ENABLED INDUSTRIES → BRANCHES/DEPARTMENTS → USERS/ROLES
→ CRITICAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS → MODULES/WORKFLOWS/TRANSACTIONS
```

All 9 Current Supported Industries are first-class and equal; Healthcare is not flagship/template (CR-05, LG-03). Legacy Register rules LG-01…LG-14 are verifiably absent from ACTIVE architecture in this package.

## 6. Status Ledger (honest, evidence-based — §33A ladder; NO CERTIFICATION WITHOUT EVIDENCE)

Ladder: DISCOVERED → SPECIFIED → FOUNDATION CERTIFIED → ARCHITECTURE CERTIFIED → DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE → IMPLEMENTED → TESTED → SECURITY VALIDATED → PRODUCTION READY → DEPLOYED → OPERATIONAL.

*(Build 1 ledger — superseded first by §9, then corrected by §10; retained as historical record.)*

| Scope | Status this build | Evidence location | Gap to next status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Governance framework & registers | SPECIFIED | Registers/, State/ | Independent re-audit |
| Core Platform capability catalog | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-01 | Entity-level field lists for all Core services |
| Application Surface Model | SPECIFIED | F-01 §3, F-06 | — |
| End-to-End Platform Workflow | SPECIFIED | F-02 | Per-step API contract definitions |
| Identity & Access (RBAC+ABAC) | SPECIFIED | F-03 | Full role→permission matrix (target 1000+ permissions, S2.9) |
| Security, Trust & Compliance | SPECIFIED | F-03 §5–§8 | Control-by-control test scenarios |
| Subscription/Billing/Licensing/Entitlements | SPECIFIED | F-01 §5 | Plan-limit entity field lists per tier |
| Data Foundation (11 categories) | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-04 | Full entity catalogs (target 500+ tables, S2.9 — Architecture phase) |
| AI Foundation | SPECIFIED | F-05 | Provider capability matrix instantiation per capability |
| Experience Layer (Web/Mobile/Desktop) | SPECIFIED | F-06 | Per-surface screen inventories |
| Healthcare & Diagnostics Suite | SPECIFIED (deepest source base) | F-07 §1 | Remaining §9-standard elements to full depth |
| Education Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-07 §2 | Same-depth completion via [AC] workflow |
| eCommerce/Retail & Commerce Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-07 §3 | idem |
| Hospitality Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-08 §1 | idem |
| Manufacturing Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-08 §2 | idem |
| Professional Services Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-08 §3 | idem |
| Government & Public Sector Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-09 §1 | idem |
| NGO/Temple/Trust Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-09 §2 | idem |
| Security & Facility Mgmt Suite | SPECIFIED (partial) | F-09 §3 | idem |
| **Project Foundation (whole)** | **IN PROGRESS — NOT CERTIFIED** | this ledger | Full-depth completion of every partial scope + No-Loss audit pass + independent re-audit ×2 |

**Explicit declaration:** no scope in this build is FOUNDATION CERTIFIED. Industry Specification Certification has not been granted to any Industry. Per §9A this ledger row is itself never evidence — the referenced documents are.

## 7. Foundation Gap Analysis (REQUIRED → EVIDENCE → GAP → RESOLUTION)

| Required element | Existing evidence | Current depth | Gap | Dependency | Resolution path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| All 9 industry suites at equal §9 depth | F-07/08/09 skeletons + rules/workflows/entities per suite | Foundation-partial | Non-Healthcare suites need remaining §9 elements ([AC]) | D-DECISIONS AC logging | Iterative deepening passes, one suite per pass | OPEN |
| Full Traceability Matrix (every knowledge unit) | TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md (section-level) | Section-level | Unit-level rows for every corpus bullet | none | Dedicated traceability pass | OPEN |
| No-Loss Audit pass | NO_LOSS_AUDIT.md (section-level accounting) | Section-level | Bullet-level zero-unaccounted verification | Traceability pass | After unit-level matrix | OPEN |
| Management System full-dimension docs | Per-suite MS tables + per-MS detail for anchor systems | Anchor-level | All ~40 dimensions per MS | Suite deepening | Per-MS documents in deepening passes | OPEN |
| API/Event Foundation contracts | F-02 §3, F-03 §4 (shape-level) | Shape-level | Endpoint-level contracts | Architecture phase | §26B Detailed Design per scope | DEFERRED (future phase, correctly) |
| GitHub delivery | not performed | — | Foundation not certified; delivery gated on certification | Certification | Branch+PR after certification | PENDING |

No gaps manufactured; no gaps hidden. One blocked item (GitHub delivery) is isolated; all unrelated work continued.

## 8. Foundation vs Future Phases

This Foundation deliberately contains **no** Architecture, Detailed Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, or Production implementation. It explicitly identifies what belongs to those phases: database schemas/migrations (Architecture/Database), endpoint-level API contracts (Detailed Design §26B), code (Development), test execution (Testing), deployment definitions execution (Deployment). Phase gates per §26A apply to each.

## 9. Build 2 Amendment — Certification Update (31-08-2026)

Supersedes the §6 "Explicit declaration" and the §6/§7 open rows; the Build 1 text above is preserved unchanged as historical record (Zero-Start evidence trail).

**Resolved since CP-F1-001:** RR-01 → F-10 (Desktop Foundation, AC-15) · RR-02 → F-11 (Regional Data Home model, DR-01) — both under explicit user authorization. **New documents:** F-10, F-11, F-12 (Industry & MS deepening — all 9 suites now cover every applicable §9 dimension at Foundation depth). **Traceability upgraded to unit level:** 372 knowledge units / 2,965 enumerated items across S1+S2, 0 unmapped (Registers/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX_UNIT.md). **No-Loss Audit: PASS at unit level** (pass 1 found 5 unmapped structural units + 1 wording finding; corrected; pass 2 clean). **Legacy Register LG-01…LG-14: verified absent** including F-10/F-11/F-12.

| Scope | Status (Build 2) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| All F-00…F-12 documents | FOUNDATION CERTIFIED | Unit-level traceability + No-Loss PASS + dual audit + this ledger's referenced documents |
| All 9 Industry Suites | Industry Specification Certification — GRANTED at Foundation depth | F-07/F-08/F-09 (identity, workflows, rules) + F-12 (all remaining §9 dimensions per suite) |
| **Project Foundation (whole)** | **FOUNDATION CERTIFIED** | Dual audit passes (D-CHECKPOINT CP-F1-002) |

**Boundary declaration:** FOUNDATION CERTIFIED only. This is not Architecture Certification, Detailed Design, Implementation, Testing, or Production Readiness — every deferred item is named in the "Deferred" notes of F-01…F-12 and belongs to the Architecture phase onward (§26A gates apply). Endpoint-level API contracts, database schemas, permission matrices, and technology selections named as deferred remain deferred.

*(§9's certification grant was REVOKED by the forensic re-verification recorded in §10 below. §9 is retained unmodified as historical record only.)*

## 10. Forensic Re-Verification Amendment — CERTIFICATION REVOKED (01-09-2026, CP-F1-003)

An independent forensic evidence audit of CP-F1-002 was performed against the v2.5 Definition of Done. §9's certification grant is **REVOKED** as evidence-insufficient; §9 is preserved above as historical record only. Per the Status & Certification Lifecycle, a status may never be skipped and a label is never evidence.

**What the audit CONFIRMED (evidence verified, not re-litigated):**
- Recovery ZIP: 31/31 files, tree matches repository; Raw Source Corpus byte-identical to originals (programmatic comparison).
- Traceability: independent re-parse of both corpus files reproduces exactly 372 heading units; the unit matrix contains 372 actual rows, 0 unmapped; the 372/2,965/0 claim is genuine. No-Loss Audit PASS at unit level stands.
- F-12 exists (14,272 bytes) and carries all claimed per-suite dimension sections; no broken cross-references found; Legacy Register LG-01…LG-14 absent from ACTIVE architecture.
- RR-01/RR-02 resolutions (F-10, F-11/DR-01) are real documents at Foundation depth.

**What the audit REFUTED (the certification-blocking findings):**
- **FF-01 (critical):** F-07 §1.3 lists HLT-HMS, HLT-RIS, HLT-PMS, HLT-CMS as **DISCOVERED**. A suite containing DISCOVERED Management Systems cannot hold Industry Specification Certification, and §9's grant to Healthcare contradicted F-07's own table. F-12 §2.1's "structurally complete" wording described provenance-level coverage, not the required depth — ARCHITECTURAL-COMPLETION is provenance, never a substitute for depth.
- **FF-02:** several Management Systems carry module enumerations without MS-specific workflows/states/rules at the depth their sibling systems have: **EDU-CTM** (no enquiry→batch lifecycle), **RTL-RSM** (no store-ops/cash-management workflow), **MFG-IWM** (covered only indirectly via PMS/PRO flows), **PSV-SDM** (no ticket/SLA workflow of its own). NGO-DMS is borderline (donor lifecycle partially carried by NGO-DFM's donation workflow) — flagged for the deepening pass.
- **FF-03:** README_FOUNDATION.md incorrectly stated the Raw Source Corpus was not republished on the branch; the corpus is present at RawSourceCorpus/ (inherited from main). Corrected.

**Corrected Status Ledger (supersedes §9's table):**

| Scope | Corrected status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F-01…F-06, F-10, F-11 (platform-level documents) | SPECIFIED | Document content at §9A depth; deferred items explicitly named |
| F-07 Healthcare & Diagnostics | SPECIFIED — PARTIAL | HLT-LIS SPECIFIED (source-deep); HLT-HMS/RIS/PMS/CMS remain DISCOVERED |
| F-07 Education · F-07 Retail · F-08 Manufacturing · F-08 Professional Services | SPECIFIED — PARTIAL | Suite-level dimensions complete (F-12); FF-02 MS gaps open |
| F-08 Hospitality · F-09 Government · F-09 NGO/Temple/Trust · F-09 Security & Facility Mgmt | SPECIFIED | All MS carry dedicated workflows + rules + F-12 dimensions (NGO-DMS borderline, flagged) |
| Industry Specification Certification (all 9 suites) | **NOT GRANTED — REVOKED** | Blocked by FF-01/FF-02 |
| Traceability / No-Loss | VERIFIED — PASS | Forensic recount, this amendment |
| **Project Foundation (whole)** | **IN PROGRESS — NOT CERTIFIED** | This amendment; blockers below |

**Remaining blockers to certification (dependency order):**
1. HLT-HMS, HLT-RIS, HLT-PMS, HLT-CMS — full Foundation-level MS specifications (vision, actors, modules, masters, transactions, workflows, states, rules, approvals, documents, notifications, KPIs, events, dependencies), Healthcare-scoped, no LIS copying.
2. EDU-CTM, RTL-RSM, MFG-IWM, PSV-SDM (+ NGO-DMS review) — MS-specific workflows/states/rules to sibling depth.
3. Per-suite Industry Specification Certification re-evaluation on the corrected evidence.
4. Full re-audit ×2 → certification decision → new recovery ZIP → PR update.
