# F-01 — PLATFORM FOUNDATION
**Document ID:** F-01 · **Version:** 0.1 · **Status:** SPECIFIED (partial) · Cross-refs: F-00 (authority), F-02 (lifecycle), F-03 (identity/security), F-04 (data), F-05 (AI), F-06 (experiences).

## 1. Canonical Business Model `[SD: MI Part II §7]`

One Core Platform serves every Industry Suite and every Tenant. **Industry** = reusable business/solution framework; **Tenant** = actual customer organization. Every Tenant has exactly one Primary Industry Suite and may enable additional Industry Suites (e.g., ABC Group: Primary = Healthcare; Enabled = Retail, Education — one Tenant, one Core Platform). Every Industry-specific Management System, Module, Workflow, Data, Report, AI Context, and Application Experience remains bound to its Tenant + Industry Context unless explicitly shared through a governed Core capability. Never a separate backend per Industry or per Tenant (LG-06, LG-07).

## 2. Platform Actors `[SD: S1 §8, S2.2 §5, §11]`

| Actor | Primary scope | Core responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform Owner** | Platform-wide | Ultimate commercial/legal ownership; approves governance-level changes; appoints Super Admins |
| **Super Admin** | Platform-wide | Governs platform, marketplace, subscription, branding standards, security policies, tenant lifecycle, module/AI/API ecosystems, deployment policies, identity/authN/authZ policies, license & device management, session management, affiliate program (commission rules, referral policies, payouts) |
| **Platform Staff** | Platform-wide (role-scoped) | Support, billing operations, compliance operations, content/CMS operations via RBAC |
| **Platform Developer** | Platform-wide (role-scoped) | Technical operations, integration support, AI Development Center review workflows (recommendations always require Super Admin approval `[SD: S2.2 §33]`) |
| **Tenant Owner** | Tenant-wide | Signs subscription; owns tenant data; delegates to Tenant Admins; controls industry enablement requests |
| **Tenant Admin** | Tenant-wide | Configures branding, domains, users, roles, modules, workflows, notifications, integrations, sync policy, affiliate/payout settings within plan entitlements `[SD: S1 §9]` |
| **Tenant business users** | Industry/Module/Role | Defined per Industry Suite (F-07…F-09); full authoritative platform user-type list preserved from S2.2 §5 |
| **End customers** (Patient/Student/Customer/Citizen/Donor/Guest…) | User-scoped | Consume Published Tenant Experiences (F-06) |
| **API Client / Service Account** | Tenant- or Platform-scoped | Machine access via API tokens under the same identity system (F-03) |

## 3. Application Surface Model `[SD: MI §12]` — ACTIVE

| Surface | Purpose | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| Public SaaS Website (www.sbglobalplus.com) | Marketing, industries, pricing, docs, demo, trust center, legal, tenant signup | Public; no platform login button |
| Platform Application (Web·Mobile·Desktop) | Platform Owner/Super Admin/Staff/Developer operations | platform.sbglobalplus.com/login |
| Tenant Management Application (Web) | Tenant profile, industries, subscription, billing, licensing, users/roles/permissions, domains, branding, API/AI/integrations, configuration | manage.sbglobalplus.com/login |
| Industry Experiences | Industry website/web app, Tenant Staff Mobile, Tenant User/Customer Mobile, optional Industry Desktop — reusable at Industry level, instantiated per Tenant | Tenant domain/subdomain |

Hard separations (LG-10…LG-12): Login Entry Point ≠ Application Surface ≠ Identity System · Public Website ≠ Platform Admin · Tenant Management ≠ Industry Operations.

## 4. Tenancy Model

- **Isolation `[SD: S2.2 §6]`:** each tenant receives complete data isolation and independent users, branches, staff, domain/website, mobile configuration, branding, API access, AI usage, storage, configuration, plus configurable data residency/region. Cross-tenant access is never permitted; verified by dedicated tenant-isolation tests (inter-tenant AND intra-tenant cross-Industry-Context — F-03 §7).
- **Structure:** Tenant → Branches → Departments → Users/Roles `[SD: S2.2 §13–§15]`; identifiers UUID + Tenant ID + Branch ID + Department ID + Industry Vertical Suite reference `[SD: S2.4]`.
- **Context binding rule `[SD: MI §7/§14]`:** where a user belongs to multiple tenants or a tenant has multiple enabled industries, Tenant Context and Industry Context resolve only through explicit user selection or deterministic surface binding — never implicit inference.

## 5. Subscription, Billing, Licensing & Entitlements

**Tiers (ACTIVE, CR-01):** Free · Starter · Pro · Premium · Enterprise. Free/Starter = self-serve signup & onboarding; Pro/Premium/Enterprise = sales-assisted `[SD: S2.2 §26]`.

**Entitlement chain (enforced server-authoritatively at every surface):**
`Tenant → Subscription Plan → Enabled/Licensed Industries → Enabled Management Systems → Enabled Modules/Features → Roles/Permissions → Application Access`

**Plan limit dimensions `[SD: S2.2 §26]`:** tenant/branch/user limits, API limits, AI limits (tokens/credits/media — F-05 §8), storage, SMS/WhatsApp/Email limits, mobile & tenant-portal access, reports, inventory, billing, website, integrations, feature permissions.

**Named business rules (trigger → condition → action):**
- **BR-SUB-01 Lifecycle** `[SD]`: Subscription states **Trial → Active → Grace Period → Suspended → Expired → Renewed**. Trigger: billing date reached; condition: payment success/failure; action: advance state, notify Tenant Owner, write audit event.
- **BR-SUB-02 No-deletion-on-expiry** `[SD]`: Trigger: state = Expired; condition: any tenant data exists; action: block all business operations except billing/renewal and data-export requests; never delete tenant data.
- **BR-SUB-03 Entitlement enforcement** `[SD/PR]`: Trigger: any business operation; condition: full chain valid (plan active, industry licensed, MS enabled, module enabled, role permits); action: allow; otherwise deny with entitlement error + audit entry (no partial bypass on any surface, including offline clients — F-03 §3).
- **BR-SUB-04 Downgrade guard** `[AC — rationale: chain integrity on plan change; logged D-DECISIONS AC-01]`: Trigger: plan downgrade; condition: current usage exceeds target-plan limits; action: require Tenant Admin remediation choice (disable modules/archive excess) before downgrade takes effect; nothing silently deleted.
- **BR-AFF-01 Affiliate engine** `[SD: S1 §8–9, S2.2 §26A]`: Core Platform affiliate/referral/commission/payout engine; governed by Super Admin, configured per Tenant/Industry; models: SaaS affiliate, tenant referral, doctor/user/business-partner referral, channel partner, reseller, franchise, agent network, commission & incentive management. Industry applications (e.g., Healthcare doctor referral commission) bind to the engine, never re-implement it.

## 6. Configuration-First Platform `[SD: S1 §10, S2.2 §7–8, §39; MI §17]`

Preference order: **Configuration → Metadata → Templates → Rules → Policies → Plugins → Automation → AI** — never hardcoding. Target: 20–25 years maintainability without developer dependency for business-rule changes. Developer intervention only for: framework changes, schema changes, core architecture, security enhancements, performance optimization, unsupported integrations, new features.

Configurable domains (Super Admin platform-wide; Tenant Admin tenant-scope within entitlements): branding, themes, typography, UI, menus, navigation, dashboards, widgets, forms, validation rules, workflows, report/invoice/print/QR/PDF/email/SMS/WhatsApp/notification templates, mobile configuration & branding, APIs, integrations, feature flags, subscription/trial plans, roles, permissions, master data, lookups, custom/dynamic fields, communication/payment/storage/AI providers, security policies, maintenance, enterprise configuration. All configuration DB-stored, versioned, auditable `[SD: S2.2 §46]`.

**Synchronization Policy (single canonical policy — CR/S1 Rec #9):** offline/online rules, automatic background sync, real-time sync, conflict resolution, local storage policy — one policy consumed by Web, Mobile, Desktop; never restated per surface.
