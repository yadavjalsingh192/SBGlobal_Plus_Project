# 1. GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC SECTOR SUITE (GOV)

## 1.1 Vision & Scope `[AC — logged D-DECISIONS AC-12]`
Operational platform for government departments, municipal bodies, public agencies and PSUs: citizen service delivery, case/file administration, permits & licenses, and revenue/tax operations — with the audit, transparency and data-sovereignty posture governed tenants require (residency & compliance via F-03 §5–§6).

**Organization types:** departments/ministries, municipal corporations/councils, panchayats/local bodies, public agencies/boards, PSUs. **Personas/roles:** Department Admin, Section Officer, Dealing Clerk/Assistant, Inspector/Field Officer, Approving Authority, Cashier/Revenue Officer, Grievance Officer, Citizen, Enterprise/Business Applicant.

## 1.2 Foundational Management Systems (4, within 2–8) `[SD: S1 §7]`
GOV-CSM Citizen Service Management System · GOV-CFM Case & File Management System · GOV-PLM Permit & License Management System · GOV-RTM Revenue & Tax Management System.

## 1.3 Core Workflows (states) `[AC]`
- **Citizen service request (GOV-CSM):** Submitted (portal/mobile/counter) → Acknowledged (ticket + SLA clock) → Triaged → Assigned → Processing → (Info Requested → Citizen Response) → Resolved → Closed → (Reopened/Escalated per SLA breach); grievance appeals tracked.
- **File movement (GOV-CFM):** File Created (numbering scheme) → Noting/Drafting → Forwarded (desk-to-desk movement log) → Approvals (level-wise) → Disposed → Archived; every movement timestamped and audited.
- **Permit/License (GOV-PLM):** Application → Fee Payment → Document Scrutiny → (Deficiency Notice → Resubmission) → Inspection (field report) → Approval/Rejection → Issuance (QR-verifiable certificate via Core document/trust services) → Renewal / Amendment / Suspension / Revocation.
- **Revenue/Tax (GOV-RTM):** Assessment → Demand Notice → Payment → Receipt → Reconciliation → (Arrears → Recovery workflow); refunds via approval chain.

## 1.4 Business Rules `[AC]`
- **BR-GOV-01 SLA escalation:** service request exceeding its category SLA auto-escalates one authority level and notifies the Grievance Officer; escalation chain configurable.
- **BR-GOV-02 File integrity:** file notings are append-only; supersession by new noting, never edit/delete; movement history immutable.
- **BR-GOV-03 Issuance gate:** permit/license issuance requires completed scrutiny + inspection report + designated authority approval + fee realization; QR verification record created at issuance.
- **BR-GOV-04 Receipt immutability:** revenue receipts are immutable once issued; corrections only via reversal + reissue (aligns with F-04 §5 financial rule).

## 1.5 Masters, Data, AI, Experiences
Masters: service categories, SLA matrices, fee schedules, document checklists, permit/license types, jurisdictions/wards/zones, designations/approval chains, tax heads. Transactions: service requests, files/notings, applications, inspections, certificates, demands, payments, receipts. AI `[SD: S2.6 — Government & NGO AI Assistant]`: citizen-assistance chatbot, application-scrutiny document intelligence (F-05 §4) `[AC]`. Experiences: Public Department Website/Citizen portal, Staff Mobile (field inspections), Citizen Mobile, optional counter Desktop. Demo data: synthetic citizens/applications, DEMO-flagged, never real PII. Acceptance: request→resolution within SLA tracking, application→issuance with QR verification, assessment→receipt cycle — each fully audited; BR-GOV-01…04 scenarios; tenant + industry-context isolation.
