# TRACEABILITY MATRIX — REQUIREMENT-LEVEL CHILD EVIDENCE
**Status:** SOURCE CHILD INVENTORY / HISTORICAL DISPOSITIONS · **Built:** 2026-09-11 · **Current ownership overlay:** 2026-09-13

The child text/IDs and original status counts below are preserved provenance. They do not establish current DD, implementation or runtime completion. The all-stages audit corrected the downstream owner routes in `F5_END_TO_END_SOURCE_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY.md`, including unrelated AI mappings, source-only headings and future test obligations. Read that current overlay with the substantive owner; do not promote this inventory's old `VERIFIED` label into a current gate.

This file complements `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX_UNIT.md`. The 372 existing rows remain stable **parent/source-heading inventory**. Child rows below are the requirement-level evidence layer for multi-requirement units. A child is never marked VERIFIED merely because its parent is VERIFIED.

**Generation/review rule:** child statements are extracted from repository-resident immutable S1/S2 list/table/requirement lines. Parent owner/section metadata is inherited only as an initial destination. If that destination is broad, missing, or not yet substantively checked, the child remains `GAP`. `DEFERRED` and `SUPERSEDED` are explicit phase/decision dispositions, not losses.

**Preserved inventory counts:** parent units=372; child evidence rows=2962; original VERIFIED=2555; GAP=0; DEFERRED=396; SUPERSEDED=11. Current semantic dispositions are independently counted in the ownership overlay.

| S1-U005-R001 | S1-U005 | # — Action — Recommendation — Why it's needed | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U005-R002 | S1-U005 | 1 — **ADD** — Data Privacy & Regulatory Compliance Framework (GDPR, India DPDP Act 2023, HIPAA-readiness for Healthcare tenants, SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 alignment, Consent Management, Data Processing Agreements) — The current draft says "Privacy First" as an adjective but has no dedicated compliance framework, consent tracking, or certification roadmap — a hard requirement for enterprise buyers and for any tenant operating in regulated industries (Healthcare, Government). | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U005-R003 | S1-U005 | 2 — **ADD** — Secrets & Key Management (centralized Key Vault / HSM, automatic key rotation, encrypted secrets store, per-tenant key isolation) — "Everything Encrypted" is listed as a principle, but there is no mechanism defined for how encryption keys and API/service secrets are generated, rotated, or isolated per tenant. Without this, "Encrypted" is just a slogan. | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U005-R004 | S1-U005 | 3 — **ADD** — API Threat Protection Layer (Rate Limiting, API Gateway, WAF, DDoS Protection, Bot/Abuse Protection) — The document defines API Authorization thoroughly but has no layer addressing volumetric/API abuse attacks — essential for a platform that is explicitly "API First" and exposes REST APIs + Webhooks to every tenant. | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U005-R005 | S1-U005 | 4 — **ADD** — Vulnerability & Incident Response Program (scheduled penetration testing, responsible disclosure / bug bounty policy, security incident response plan, breach notification SLA) — Zero Trust and Security-First are stated as goals, but there is no operational program to discover or respond to vulnerabilities — this is what enterprise security questionnaires actually check for. | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U005-R006 | S1-U005 | 5 — **ADD** — Data Residency & Sovereignty Controls (per-tenant/per-region data storage selection) — For a Multi-Tenant, Multi-Industry, global-facing SaaS, several prospective enterprise/government tenants will require contractual guarantees about which country/region their data is stored in. Not addressed in the current tenant isolation language. | SD | Platform-wide | F-03 | §5–§6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U006-R001 | S1-U006 | # — Action — Recommendation — Why it's needed | SD | Platform-wide | F-06/F-01 | §2 / §6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U006-R002 | S1-U006 | 6 — **ADD** — Trust Center / Public Status Page + Compliance Badge section on homepage (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, uptime SLA badges), plus a Live Chat / AI Chatbot widget site-wide — The site plans a "Security showcase" section but nothing that proves it — enterprise buyers expect a live uptime/status page and visible certification badges before booking a demo. Self-serve visitors (see Recommendation #8) also need an immediate way to get answers instead of waiting on a sales callback. | SD | Platform-wide | F-06/F-01 | §2 / §6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U006-R003 | S1-U006 | 7 — **ADD** — Legal & Compliance page set in sitemap (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, SLA, Data Processing Agreement) + Cookie Consent Banner — The sitemap has Resources → Documentation/Blog/FAQ but no legal footer pages at all. This is both a compliance gap (tied to Security Recommendation #1) and a standard expectation for any SaaS homepage. | SD | Platform-wide | F-06/F-01 | §2 / §6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U006-R004 | S1-U006 | 8 — **REPLACE** — Add a **self-serve signup / ROI calculator path** alongside the existing "Book Demo / Request Quote" CTA structure — Conflict identified: the Subscription plans explicitly include **Free** and **Starter** tiers, but every CTA in the current homepage/loader plan (Book Demo, Request Quote, Start Enterprise Journey) is enterprise-sales-gated. A Free/Starter tenant should be able to self-serve sign up without talking to sales — otherwise the pricing tier structure and the conversion funnel contradict each other. | SD | Platform-wide | F-06/F-01 | §2 / §6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
| S1-U006-R005 | S1-U006 | 9 — **DELETE / CONSOLIDATE** — Remove the literal duplicated line under Tenant Philosophy ("Referral Rules Reward / Policies Payout Methods" appears twice) and collapse the 5+ separate restatements of "Automatic Background Synchronization" (Target Vision, Core Principles, Mobile Theme, Desktop Theme, Tenant Philosophy) into a single canonical **Synchronization Policy** referenced wherever needed — Improves readability and removes internal duplication/conflict risk when this becomes structured documentation — duplicated bullets create maintenance drift when one copy is updated and the others are not. | SD | Platform-wide | F-06/F-01 | §2 / §6 | Foundation | — | VERIFIED |
