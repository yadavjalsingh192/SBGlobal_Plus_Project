# FINAL PRE-DEVELOPMENT INDEPENDENT ADVERSARIAL AUDIT — 2026-09-13

**Hypothesis:** THE PROJECT IS STILL NOT READY FOR DEVELOPMENT.  
**Evaluated metadata/evidence HEAD:** `2cbe65b3f137d9d5905d693c68200bc308a223ad`  
**Final substantive Foundation HEAD:** `4b5ec3667ae81c0b4c92a4cf0daba0282edd4131`  
**Final substantive Architecture HEAD:** `9453ebb0140670984753cec9e66613475789610b`  
**Final substantive Detailed Design HEAD:** `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`

## 1. Repository truth
- Working branch: `docs/architecture-branch-2`.
- `main`: `3911590ff2020993ce51b32d7b091efd6f5f466f`.
- Working branch: **271 commits ahead / 0 behind** at final verification.
- Review PR: **#2 OPEN DRAFT**, base `main`, head `docs/architecture-branch-2`, not merged.
- No Phase 1–5 main merge.
- RawSourceCorpus blobs remain exactly:
  - S1 `a9f63a64448a347edd0f2b0c74094284ee953c1b`
  - S2 `91c461de5e0d171f71d0bb89cd039953a1f1ecfd`
- PROJECT_MANIFEST, BACKUP_METADATA and PRE_DEVELOPMENT_RECOVERY_MANIFEST parse as valid JSON.

## 2. Phase gates
- Phase 1 RawSource → Foundation: **PASS**.
- Phase 2 Foundation → Architecture/ADR: **PASS**.
- Phase 3 Detailed Design fresh revalidation: **PASS**.
- Phase 4 cross-layer traceability/isolation/determinism: **PASS**.
- Phase 5 repository/state consistency: **PASS**.
- Phase 5 mandatory physical checkpoint ZIP: **BLOCKED**.

## 3. Adversarial substantive attacks
Fresh evidence was challenged for:
- RawSource loss or stranded valid source requirements;
- Vision conflict / Healthcare-first leakage;
- stale technology/auth/commercial assumptions;
- Core capability duplication or Industry leakage;
- wrong/missing Tenant + Industry Context;
- same-Tenant sibling-Industry data/document/event/webhook/report/export leakage;
- pooled/dedicated DB context errors;
- offline context rebinding;
- AI/RAG/tool/API/memory/media privilege/context leakage;
- Country Pack permission widening;
- tenant rule arbitrary executable content;
- role-specific mobile app proliferation;
- Platform Mobile misclassified as a Tenant app;
- branding override weakening security/accessibility semantics;
- Future Industry premature licensing/live activation;
- missing MS acceptance/workflow/KPI contracts;
- unresolved REVIEW_REQUIRED/TODO/TBD design debt;
- orphan source/user/Architecture decisions;
- Development or QA behavior requiring material invention.

**Substantive result:** all above are closed by current Foundation/Architecture/DD/acceptance evidence.

## 4. Evidence result
- Foundation P0/P1: **0/0**.
- Architecture P0/P1: **0/0**.
- Detailed Design P0/P1: **0/0**.
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**.
- 41/41 canonical MS acceptance namespaces: **PASS**.
- 41/41 authoritative major workflow matrices: **PASS**.
- 165/165 named KPI/report metrics mapped: **PASS**.
- 9/9 Current Supported Industry DD artifacts: **PASS**.
- Development determinism: **9/9 YES**.
- QA determinism: **9/9 YES**.
- Cross-layer isolation: **PASS**.
- Phase-1 recovered requirement chains: **0 current orphan**.
- Future Industry remains promotion-gated and is not silently added to the current nine.

## 5. Backup/recovery attack
Governing MASTER_INSTRUCTION §24 requires a recoverable checkpoint package/ZIP.

What exists:
- exact Git recovery snapshot indexed at HEAD `f09c26b2d01b97d0f50b20d94bad374dbc4252c7`;
- tree SHA `cb60aba0e91bab2d4eca2216233cfdbe484c1176`;
- 125 files / 4,048,092 blob bytes indexed;
- immutable GitHub archive URL recorded;
- full per-file path/blob SHA/size recovery manifest stored in `State/PRE_DEVELOPMENT_RECOVERY_MANIFEST.json`.

What does **not** exist:
- a physically materialized checkpoint ZIP in this execution;
- independent content-open verification of that ZIP;
- ZIP SHA-256.

Reason: the current execution environment cannot resolve/download GitHub archive content or clone github.com from the container. This is a real tooling limitation, not a substantive design defect.

**CLOSURE-BACKUP-01 remains OPEN.**

## 6. Severity
- Product/Foundation/Architecture/DD P0: **0**
- Product/Foundation/Architecture/DD P1: **0**
- Closure governance blocker: **1** — CLOSURE-BACKUP-01
- Avoidable substantive P2: **0**

## 7. Final verdict

**VISION-CENTRIC ULTRA-DEEP SUBSTANTIVE AUDIT — PASS**  
**FOUNDATION — PASS**  
**ARCHITECTURE — PASS**  
**DETAILED DESIGN — COMPLETE / PASS**  
**CROSS-LAYER ISOLATION / TRACEABILITY / DETERMINISM — PASS**  
**FINAL PRE-DEVELOPMENT CLOSURE — BLOCKED BY MANDATORY PHYSICAL BACKUP PACKAGE**  
**DEVELOPMENT NOT AUTHORIZED**

The project is substantively ready for Development, but governance does not permit the READY FOR DEVELOPMENT status until the required physical checkpoint ZIP is actually materialized, verified, and its SHA-256 recorded. No other current blocker was found.

## User-Directed Closure Amendment — 2026-09-13

After this audit, the owner explicitly waived the physical pre-development ZIP as a Development-readiness requirement and stated that any desired repository clone/archive backup will be handled manually. This decision is recorded as `UD-BACKUP-01`.

Therefore:
- the audit's **substantive PASS** remains unchanged;
- `CLOSURE-BACKUP-01` is closed by explicit user direction;
- no physical ZIP is claimed to have been created by this session;
- the final pre-development gate becomes **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT — SUPPORTED**;
- work continues on `docs/architecture-branch-2`;
- `main` remains unchanged by this continuation.

This amendment changes only the backup-gate disposition; it does not alter Foundation, Architecture, Detailed Design, isolation, traceability or determinism evidence.
