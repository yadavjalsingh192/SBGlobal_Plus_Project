# REVIEW_REQUIRED — Historical Pre-Development / Current Audit Overlay
**Updated:** 2026-09-19 · **Current checkpoint:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-WRITER-BOUNDARY-001`

Current Development evidence is [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md): verified executable `b420e1547d9366f3c21612643e2ee04c3214c992` / tree `80fdbb7377247f374801791f09ae75d118ae832b`, with Core **180/180 PASS**, PostgreSQL **44/44 PASS**, Database **43 migrations / 37 verification files PASS**, and Next.js 15.5.25 production build / deterministic npm lock / generated-state cleanliness **PASS**. The active checkpoint is `DEV-COMMERCIAL-WRITER-BOUNDARY-001`; the next governed slice is the atomic Commercial publication transaction floor. Public `core.commercial.subscription.changePlan` remains blocked until DD-062 assessment/resolution evidence persistence and Billing/approval producer runtime exist. Earlier pre-development and Database sections below retain their historical scope.

## Historical pre-development result

## Backup disposition
`CLOSURE-BACKUP-01` is **CLOSED — USER-DIRECTED WAIVER** by `UD-BACKUP-01`.
A physical pre-development ZIP was not created by this session and is not represented as created. The owner will handle any desired manual clone/archive separately.

## Historical pre-development gate
**READY FOR DEVELOPMENT — SUPPORTED.**

Development continues on `docs/architecture-branch-2`. No merge to `main` has been performed in this continuation.


## Development findings — Database phase

| ID | Severity | Scope | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEV-DB-P1-01 | P1 dependent-slice blocker | Audit / Outbox / Webhook delivery | DD-05 requires monthly RANGE partitioning for append-only evidence tables, while DD-07/DD-15 define a single-column `id uuid PK`. PostgreSQL declarative partitioning cannot enforce a parent-level unique/primary key that omits the partition key. | **OPEN — blocks only these partitioned evidence tables** |

Required resolution must preserve both stable event/audit identity and monthly partition behavior without weakening Tenant/Industry RLS or idempotency. No silent composite-key substitution has been made.


### DEV-DB-P1-01 closure — 2026-09-13
**RESOLVED.** Decision `DEV-DB-AC-001` preserves global UUID/idempotency using unpartitioned identity registries while full evidence rows remain monthly RANGE-partitioned. Migration `database/migrations/0008_audit_event_outbox_webhook.sql` implements the pattern; `database/verification/0008_audit_event_outbox_webhook.verify.sql` verifies partitioning, forced RLS and uniqueness evidence.

Open dependent blocker: **0**.

## Current all-stages gate — 2026-09-13
No approval-blocked correction remains in the current audited scope. The previous OPEN DEV-DB-P1-01 row is closed by its recorded resolution, not an unresolved permission question. Current defects/corrections and CI are in `ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`. RawSource immutability, no main merge, no production deployment and Future-Industry promotion approval rules remain in force.

## Core adapter continuation boundary — 2026-09-14
The current physical-source mapping is `../Development/CORE_PERSISTENCE_ADAPTER_MAP.md` (DD-040/041/042/043 overlay). Compiled permission persistence/read adapters and the Current Supported Industry presentation catalog/read adapter are implemented and tested. DD-043's protected PLATFORM_GLOBAL identity/API-credential/SQL floor is also implemented and exact-head CI verified at `3e7b2927839d289240eb389902563f5ab3d68074`. No current approval-blocked REVIEW_REQUIRED item exists. The exact next Development dependency is concrete provider/session-security integration, followed by PDP/ABAC, Commercial validation and transports.
