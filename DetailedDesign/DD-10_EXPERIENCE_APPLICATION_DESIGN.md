# DD-10 — EXPERIENCE / APPLICATION DETAILED DESIGN
**Wave:** 2 · **Status:** PHASE 3 REVALIDATED — EXPERIENCE CONTRACTS  
**Traces:** F-01 §3 · F-06 · A-08 · ADR-011 · DD-02/DD-03/DD-04/DD-06/DD-08

## 1. Canonical four-surface ownership
| Surface | Responsibility | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Public SaaS Website | public marketing/content/trust/legal/signup/demo/quote | tenant operations, platform administration |
| Platform Application | Platform Owner/Super Admin/authorized staff operations | tenant industry business workflows |
| Tenant Management Application | tenant administration/configuration/commercial/security | operational industry transactions |
| Reusable Industry Experiences | tenant-bound industry-domain operations across Web + exactly two logical Tenant mobile apps + optional Desktop | separate identity/backend/platform admin |

All authenticated surfaces use DD-02 RequestContext, DD-03 access decision, DD-04 entitlements, DD-06 OperationContracts and DD-08 document access. UI visibility is advisory only.

## 2. Screen contract standard
Every authenticated screen is specified by: Screen ID · Surface · Route · Purpose · Users · scopeClass · permission · entitlement · Industry Context requirement · query operations · commands · form/validation where applicable · empty/loading/error/restricted states · audit behavior · responsive behavior · accessibility.

Public pages use equivalent content fields: Page ID · route · content owner · Payload CMS ownership · public/private · CTA · auth transition · localization · SEO/metadata · accessibility · responsive behavior · analytics event family.

## 3. Public SaaS Website inventory
All public content is Payload CMS 3-managed unless marked application-generated. Final copy/assets are not part of DD.

Public form submissions create server-side OperationContracts; spam/rate/consent controls apply. Analytics identifiers must not leak sensitive form fields.

## 4. Platform Application route hierarchy
Base: `/platform`; scope primarily PLATFORM_GLOBAL. Tenant-targeted support/elevation views switch to explicit governed tenant/context target and never become implicit wildcard access.

| Screen ID | Route | Purpose / users | Scope | Permission | Core operations | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLT-001 | /platform | executive/ops dashboard | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.platform.dashboard.view | platform projections | view only |
| PLT-002 | /platform/tenants | tenant directory/admin | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.tenancy.tenant.view/manage | tenant list/create/status | mutations audited |
| PLT-003 | /platform/catalog/plans | plan/version catalog | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.commercial.plan.manage | plan/version publish/retire | all changes |
| PLT-004 | /platform/catalog/industries | Current/Future Industry catalog + promotion governance | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.catalog.industry.manage | draft/promote/retire catalog definitions; promotion approval evidence | mandatory |
| PLT-005 | /platform/catalog/modules | MS/module catalog | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.catalog.module.manage | module metadata | changes |
| PLT-006 | /platform/commercial/policies | route/commercial policy | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.commercial.policy.manage | policy versioning | mandatory |
| PLT-007 | /platform/features | feature flags | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.config.feature.manage | flag/version | mandatory |
| PLT-008 | /platform/operators | platform principals/roles | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.identity.operator.manage | operator/role admin | mandatory |
| PLT-009 | /platform/support | support cases/elevation | PLATFORM_GLOBAL→explicit target | core.support.elevation.request/use | elevation lifecycle | mandatory high-risk |
| PLT-010 | /platform/ai/providers | AI provider/model registry | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.ai.provider.manage | DD-09 operations | mandatory |
| PLT-011 | /platform/integrations | integration definitions/adapters | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.integration.registry.manage | integration registry | mandatory |
| PLT-012 | /platform/security | security/compliance posture | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.security.posture.view/manage | DD-16 policies | mandatory |
| PLT-013 | /platform/audit | platform audit explorer | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.audit.platform.view | filtered audit queries | access audited |
| PLT-014 | /platform/operations | deployment/health visibility | PLATFORM_GLOBAL | core.operations.view | read-only DD-14/DD-15 projections | access recorded where sensitive |

All screens define loading skeleton, no-data guidance, safe error state, restricted/step-up state, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen-reader labels, responsive table/card alternatives.

## 5. Tenant Management Application
Base `/manage`; default scope TENANT_CORE. Industry Context is required only when configuring an industry-owned activation/configuration and is explicitly selected.

| ID | Route | Purpose | Permission / entitlement | Scope | Operations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TEN-001 | /manage | tenant admin dashboard | core.tenancy.dashboard.view | TENANT_CORE | admin projections |
| TEN-002 | /manage/profile | tenant profile | core.tenancy.profile.manage | TENANT_CORE | profile/config |
| TEN-003 | /manage/org | branches/departments/locations | core.tenancy.org.manage | TENANT_CORE | org CRUD/workflows |
| TEN-004 | /manage/industries | primary/enabled industries | core.tenancy.industry.manage + license | TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY selector | activate/configure |
| TEN-005 | /manage/subscription | subscription/plan | core.commercial.subscription.view/change | TENANT_CORE | DD-04 operations |
| TEN-006 | /manage/licenses | licenses | core.commercial.license.manage | TENANT_CORE | assignment/status |
| TEN-007 | /manage/addons | add-ons | core.commercial.addon.manage | TENANT_CORE | purchase/activate |
| TEN-008 | /manage/usage | usage meters | core.commercial.usage.view | TENANT_CORE | queries |
| TEN-009 | /manage/systems | MS activations | core.tenancy.ms.manage + entitlement | TENANT_INDUSTRY | activation/config |
| TEN-010 | /manage/modules | modules/features | core.tenancy.module.manage | TENANT_INDUSTRY where industry-owned | config |
| TEN-011 | /manage/users | memberships | core.identity.membership.manage | TENANT_CORE | invite/suspend |
| TEN-012 | /manage/roles | roles/permissions | core.identity.role.manage | TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY | DD-03 |
| TEN-013 | /manage/api | API credentials | core.integration.api_credential.manage + API entitlement | TENANT_CORE | create/rotate/revoke |
| TEN-014 | /manage/integrations | tenant integrations | core.integration.tenant.manage | TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY | DD-06 extension |
| TEN-015 | /manage/webhooks | webhook subscriptions | core.integration.webhook.manage | TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY | DD-07 |
| TEN-016 | /manage/domains | domains/subdomains | core.config.domain.manage | TENANT_CORE | verify/map |
| TEN-017 | /manage/branding | branding/theme | core.config.brand.manage | TENANT_CORE | brand config draft/preview/accessibility validate/publish/activate/rollback |
| TEN-018 | /manage/notifications | notification preferences/providers | core.notification.config.manage | TENANT_CORE | configuration |
| TEN-019 | /manage/ai | tenant/industry AI config | core.ai.config.manage + AI entitlement | TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY | DD-09 |
| TEN-020 | /manage/security | security/MFA/device/session policies | core.security.policy.manage | TENANT_CORE | DD-16 |
| TEN-021 | /manage/billing | invoices/payments | core.billing.view/manage | TENANT_CORE | billing operations |
| TEN-022 | /manage/documents | config/legal/admin documents | core.document.admin | TENANT_CORE | DD-08 |
| TEN-023 | /manage/audit | tenant audit | core.audit.tenant.view | TENANT_CORE | scoped query/export |
| TEN-024 | /manage/settings | tenant configuration | core.config.manage | TENANT_CORE | configuration |

Operational POS, LIS, exams, production, citizen cases, etc. never appear here except configuration links; those belong Industry Experiences.

## 5A. Canonical design-token / branding contract

`ResolvedBrandContext{platformBrandVersion, industryBrandVersion?, tenantBrandVersion?, userPresentationPreferenceVersion?, tokenSet, typographySet, assetRefs, accessibilityValidationVersion}`.

Resolution order:
1. Platform Brand Default;
2. allowed Industry Experience presentation override;
3. Tenant branding/white-label override;
4. user presentation preference.

Lower layers cannot override protected semantic/security tokens: danger/error, warning, success, focus visibility, disabled/restricted, security alert, destructive action, consent/legal notice, accessibility contrast floor.

Initial Platform defaults trace to F-06 §6.1, including primary `#06B6D4`, secondary `#0F766E`, accent `#7C3AED`, approved semantic/background/text tokens and Inter/Poppins/Roboto defaults. DD stores them as versioned Platform Brand configuration rather than source-code literals scattered through screens.

Brand publication flow:
`DRAFT → PREVIEW → ACCESSIBILITY_VALIDATION → REVIEW → PUBLISHED → ACTIVE → RETIRED`.
Activation with failed contrast/accessibility validation is denied. Tenant brand publication cannot change Platform product identity, security semantics, permission logic or audit labels.

## 5B. Exactly-two Tenant mobile application contract

Canonical Tenant mobile app classes:
- `TENANT_STAFF_APP`
- `TENANT_USER_APP`

Every mobile route/capability manifest declares exactly one of those classes. Industry role labels (Patient, Doctor, Teacher, Student, Parent, Cashier, Guard, Technician, Citizen, Donor, Guest, etc.) are persona/role metadata inside the two app classes, never independent application classes or binaries.

`MobileCapabilityManifest{capabilityId, industryCode, managementSystemId?, appClass, routeId, requiredPermission, requiredEntitlement?, offlineClass, featureFlagRef?, minimumAppVersion?, status, version}`.

The Platform Application may have a separately governed Platform Mobile channel; it is not counted as a Tenant mobile app and never uses a Tenant appClass.

## 6. Reusable Industry Experience shell
Base route is tenant-domain dependent; shell route prefix may be `/app`. Shell owns:
- verified session/client workspace bootstrap;
- explicit tenant switcher when multiple memberships;
- explicit industry switcher for enabled/permitted industries;
- org-unit workspace selector;
- entitlement/RBAC/ABAC-composed navigation;
- notification center;
- task/inbox;
- global search;
- help/profile/theme;
- offline/sync indicator.

Industry packages own their domain routes/screens and are Wave 3.

## 7. Navigation composition contract
Input:
`NavigationInput{principalId, tenantId, industryContextId?, orgUnitId?, entitlementSnapshotVersion, permissionVersion, applicablePolicyVersion, activatedModules[], channel}`.

Process:
1 load server-approved navigation manifest for surface/channel;
2 filter by scope/module activation;
3 filter by entitlement hint;
4 filter by RBAC permission hint;
5 apply ABAC visibility restrictions;
6 render hierarchy/order;
7 every actual query/command re-runs server access decision.

Navigation cache key includes tenant + industry + org + entitlement + permission/policy versions + channel. Context switch invalidates prior private navigation/data state.

## 8. Common state contract
Every screen supports:
- Loading: deterministic skeleton/progress without stale sibling-context data.
- Empty: actionable, permission-safe explanation.
- Error: safe error code/correlation, no secret/stack.
- Restricted: deny/restrict/upgrade/step-up state from DD-03.
- Offline: only where DD-11 classifies capability offline-capable.

## 9. Accessibility/responsive
WCAG 2.1 AA baseline: keyboard complete, visible focus, semantic landmarks, labels/errors, contrast, motion preference, captions/transcripts where media, no color-only state. Mobile/tablet/desktop layouts preserve capability, not just visual shrink.

## 10. Analytics/privacy
Public analytics uses consent policy where required. Authenticated product analytics records route/screen capability events with tenant/context pseudonymous attribution only where policy permits; never raw form/health/financial content.

## 11. Acceptance
- persisted/declared Tenant mobile appClass outside `TENANT_STAFF_APP|TENANT_USER_APP` → validation failure;
- Patient/Doctor/Student/Guard/etc. may select persona-specific routes only inside the appropriate canonical Tenant app class;
- Tenant branding override that weakens protected semantic/accessibility token floor → publish denied;
- Future Industry marked live/Current Supported without promotion approval/gate evidence → catalog activation denied;
- Public ≠ Platform ≠ Tenant Management ≠ Industry Operations; context switch clears incompatible private state; no screen bypasses server guard; no Healthcare-first navigation behavior; industry domain screens remain deferred to Wave 3.


## 12. Canonical operational host-shell ownership
Exactly four responsibility surfaces exist:
1. **Public SaaS Website** — public marketing/content/trust/signup.
2. **Platform Application** — platform-operator governance/operations.
3. **Tenant Management Application** — tenant administration/configuration/commercial/security only.
4. **Reusable Industry Experience Shell** — the sole host responsibility for tenant-bound operational Industry packages and their Web/Mobile/Desktop experiences.

The Tenant Management Application MUST NOT host operational transactions such as HLT-LIS samples/results, RTL-POS sales/refunds, EDU-EMS marks/results, MFG-PMS production/QC, GOV-PLM permit processing, NGO-DFM donation allocation or SFM-PMS patrol execution. It may configure/enable those systems and deep-link to the Industry Experience Shell after a fresh context/access resolution.

`Tenant App` is not a canonical machine/responsibility name because it is ambiguous. Use `Tenant Management Application` or `Reusable Industry Experience Shell` explicitly.

### Surface enforcement
Every OperationContract declares `allowedSurfaceClasses[]`. Server RequestContext carries verified `surfaceClass`. A call from a disallowed surface returns:
- error class: `POLICY_DENIED`
- reasonCode: `SURFACE_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED`
- domain mutation: 0
- domain event: 0
- audit: authorization/security denial with surfaceClass + operationId.

Navigation hiding is advisory only; the server surface policy is authoritative.

## 13. Platform Application channel eligibility
Platform Application Web is the default management channel. Mobile/Desktop activation is governed by `PlatformChannelEligibilityPolicy`.

A capability may be enabled on **Platform Mobile** only when all are true:
- real platform operational mobility need (on-call approval, incident/support response, field/platform operations);
- no requirement for unsupported high-risk secret/material handling;
- equivalent DD-03/DD-16 authentication, device and audit controls exist;
- Product Owner and Security Owner approve the capability manifest version.

A capability may be enabled on **Platform Desktop** only when all are true:
- native device/file/peripheral or controlled workstation capability is materially required, or long-running operator workflow benefits from managed desktop;
- DD-12 native allowlist and signed-update controls cover it;
- Product Owner and Security Owner approve the capability manifest version.

Channel enablement fields: `capabilityId, channel, businessJustification, riskClass, requiredNativeCapabilities[], securityControlProfile, approvedByProduct, approvedBySecurity, effectiveFrom, version, status`.
Unsupported channels are absent/disabled and server operations still enforce `allowedSurfaceClasses` and channel policy.


## 14. Current Supported Industry presentation persistence
DD-042 in DD-18 owns the global presentation catalog for the nine Current Supported Industries. Tenant `industry_context` remains activation/state truth and stores only `industry_code`; display key/name, route slug, icon key, experience-package key, UI sort order and presentation version come from `core_master.current_supported_industry`. Future Industry definitions do not become readable here until the DD-035 promotion gate has completed and Control Plane publishes the catalog row. Catalog sort order is presentation only and never establishes industry priority.
