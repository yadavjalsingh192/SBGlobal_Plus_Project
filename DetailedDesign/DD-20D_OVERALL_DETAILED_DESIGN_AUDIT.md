# DD-20D — OVERALL DETAILED DESIGN ADVERSARIAL AUDIT — PHASE 3
**Date:** 2026-09-13 · **Evaluated substantive HEAD:** `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`
**Adversarial hypothesis:** THE COMPLETE DETAILED DESIGN IS STILL NOT READY FOR DEVELOPMENT.

## Fresh coverage
All 55 DetailedDesign files were freshly retrieved/inspected in Phase 3, including all nine Industry DD artifacts and the large acceptance/workflow/determinism evidence files.

## Adversarial attacks
PASS was required for:
- wrong/missing Tenant + Industry Context;
- sibling-Industry row/document/event/webhook/offline/AI leakage;
- stale identity/commercial/technology semantics;
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form ownership ambiguity;
- arbitrary tenant executable rule content;
- country/localization pack permission widening;
- AI API/provider bypass;
- unscoped AI memory/media/prompt behavior;
- role-specific mobile app proliferation;
- Tenant branding weakening security/accessibility semantics;
- Future Industry premature commercial/live activation;
- export/portability bypassing authorization/residency/retention;
- per-MS missing acceptance/workflow/KPI contracts;
- stale audit/head/certification evidence.

## Evidence result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**
- 41/41 MS acceptance namespaces: PASS
- 41/41 MS workflow matrices: PASS
- 165/165 named KPI metrics mapped: PASS
- 9/9 Industry DD files: PASS
- Development determinism: 9/9 YES
- QA determinism: 9/9 YES
- Phase-3 traceability: PASS
- Phase-3 ambiguity sweep: PASS
- RawSource/Foundation/Architecture upstream deltas: all have DD owners/tests

## Verdict
**REQUIREMENT SET COMPLETE — SUPPORTED**  
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE — SUPPORTED**  
**READY FOR FINAL PRE-DEVELOPMENT GATE — SUPPORTED**

This completes the Detailed Design gate and authorizes the project to enter the final pre-development closure/adversarial stages. It does **not** by itself authorize Development; the overall project gate still requires final cross-layer isolation, repository/state/backup closure and final adversarial verification.
