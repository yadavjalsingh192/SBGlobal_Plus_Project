# RETAIL & COMMERCE — MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DETAILED DESIGN
**Wave:** 3 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE

## RTL-RSM — Retail Store Management System
**Foundation owner:** F-13 §2.2 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · **Scope:** TENANT_INDUSTRY

**Purpose / actors / modules.** Store-day, staff shifts, cash control and in-store execution backbone. Actors: Store Manager, Cashier, Floor Staff, Retail Admin. Modules: store/counters; shifts; opening/closing; floats/pickups; price execution; stocktake; service desk.

### Entity design
All tables carry `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, `industry_context_id uuid NOT NULL`, `row_version bigint`, audit timestamps/actors, `is_demo boolean default false`; indexes start with tenant+industry.

| Entity / table | Domain fields (in addition to baseline) | Constraints / indexes | Sensitivity / retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| StoreDay / `rtl_rsm_store_day` | store_ref uuid, business_date date, state enum(PLANNED,OPENING,TRADING,CLOSING,RECONCILIATION,CLOSED), opened_by uuid?, closed_by uuid? | PK id; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,store_ref,business_date); INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, state, updated_at) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; financial-audit policy |
| CashMovement / `rtl_rsm_cash_movement` | store_day_id uuid, movement_type enum(FLOAT,PICKUP,BANKING,VARIANCE), amount_minor bigint, currency char(3), reason_code text?, actor_id uuid | PK id; CHECK amount_minor>=0; INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, store_day_id) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; financial-audit policy |
| CounterShift / `rtl_rsm_counter_shift` | store_day_id uuid, counter_code text, principal_id uuid, started_at timestamptz, ended_at timestamptz?, state enum(PLANNED,OPEN,CLOSED,RECONCILED) | PK id; INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, store_day_id, state); PARTIAL INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, state) WHERE state NOT IN ('CLOSED','CANCELLED','RETIRED','EXPIRED','REVOKED','COMPLETED') | INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL; policy retention |
| StoreChecklistEntry / `rtl_rsm_checklist` | store_day_id uuid, checklist_code text, item_code text, state enum(PENDING,DONE,EXCEPTION), completed_by uuid?, note text? | append-only where history/evidence; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,store_day_id,checklist_code,item_code) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; evidentiary retention |

Relationships are FK-constrained within the same tenant+industry context; cross-MS references store owning resource IDs and are resolved through service/projection contracts, never direct foreign-table reads. Ownership columns are immutable.

### Workflow / state machine
Canonical primary state: **PLANNED → OPENING → TRADING → CLOSING → RECONCILIATION → CLOSED**.  
Invalid transition: any transition not in the MS transition table is rejected with `RTL-RSM_STATE_INVALID`. Required transition facts: expected row version, actor, permission, reason where exceptional, correlation ID. Variance branch becomes REVIEW/APPROVED/INVESTIGATED before day close when threshold exceeded.

### Business rules / approvals
- **RTL-RSM-R01** Day closes only when all POS sessions reconciled.
- **RTL-RSM-R02** Price changes use approved effective price-list version.
- **RTL-RSM-R03** Every float/pickup/variance is append-only evidence.
- **RTL-RSM-R04** Stock adjustments require approval and reason.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

### Permissions / ABAC
`rtl.rsm.day.open` · `rtl.rsm.day.close` · `rtl.rsm.cash.record` · `rtl.rsm.variance.approve` · `rtl.rsm.price.execute` · `rtl.rsm.stocktake.post`.  
ABAC dimensions: org unit/branch/site, resource ownership, workflow state, sensitivity, time/device where relevant. ABAC may restrict but never grant beyond RBAC. 

### Documents / notifications / reporting
Documents: opening/closing checklist, cash reconciliation, stocktake record. All use DD-08 DocumentMeta.  
Notifications: variance, missing reconciliation, checklist exception; sensitive payloads use generic push preview.  
Reports/KPIs: sales/store, cash variance, shrinkage, checklist compliance; projections preserve Tenant+Industry ownership and exports require report/export permission.

### APIs / events / integrations
tRPC operations: `ind.rtl.rsm.day_open` · `ind.rtl.rsm.day_close` · `ind.rtl.rsm.cash_record` · `ind.rtl.rsm.variance_approve` · `ind.rtl.rsm.price_execute`. REST only for real external integration. Inputs include resource ID/version and domain fields; outputs use DD-06 envelope; writes are idempotent where retryable.  
Events v1: `rtl.rsm.day_open` · `rtl.rsm.day_close` · `rtl.rsm.cash_record`. Payloads include aggregate ID/state/version and minimal domain facts in DD-07 envelope.  
Integrations: POS sessions, IWM counts, OMS returns; adapters use DD-06 IntegrationDefinition/ProviderAdapter and secret references.

### AI / experience / offline
AI: may summarize exceptions; cannot approve cash variance. RAG sources inherit ACL/sensitivity; tools bind the listed OperationContracts and acting-user permission; high-risk side effects require approval.  
Web routes: `/app/rtl/rsm` list/detail/workflow/report views. Mobile: manager checklist/approval. Desktop: store control/POS-adjacent.  
Offline class: **CONTROLLED_OFFLINE_MUTATION**. Checklists may queue; cash close/adjustments require server reconciliation.

### Configuration / entitlement / dependencies / audit
Configuration: store hours, counters, variance thresholds, checklists. Security floors cannot be overridden.  
Entitlement: suite license + `RTL-RSM` MS entitlement + module/feature entitlements; business services never hard-code plan names.  
Dependencies: RTL-POS/IWM/OMS. Audit: every approval, state transition, financial/regulated correction, export and cross-module handoff records action/resource/state/reason/correlation.

### Tests / acceptance
Positive: open→trade→reconcile→close. Negative: unreconciled session/variance threshold blocks close. Isolation: wrong tenant and same-tenant wrong Industry Context must return no data/effect. Entitlement-disabled MS must deny. AI retrieval/tool uses same authorization. Unauthorized document/event consumer denied.  
**Acceptance:** store day/cash evidence is immutable and auditable.

## RTL-POS — Point of Sale Management System
**Foundation owner:** F-13 §4.2 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · **Scope:** TENANT_INDUSTRY

**Purpose / actors / modules.** In-store checkout/session, pricing/tax, tender, receipt and reconciliation. Actors: Store Manager, Cashier, Retail Admin. Modules: register/session; cart; pricing/tax; tender; receipt; void/refund; reconciliation; offline.

### Entity design
All tables carry `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, `industry_context_id uuid NOT NULL`, `row_version bigint`, audit timestamps/actors, `is_demo boolean default false`; indexes start with tenant+industry.

| Entity / table | Domain fields (in addition to baseline) | Constraints / indexes | Sensitivity / retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| PosSession / `rtl_pos_session` | store_day_ref uuid, counter_code text, cashier_id uuid, opening_float_minor bigint, state enum(OPEN,LOCKED,CLOSING,CLOSED,RECONCILED) | PK id; one OPEN per counter/cashier policy; INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, state, updated_at) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; financial-audit policy |
| Sale / `rtl_pos_sale` | session_id uuid, sale_no text, customer_ref uuid?, total_minor bigint, tax_minor bigint, currency char(3), state enum(DRAFT,TENDERING,PAID,VOIDED,REFUNDED_PARTIAL,REFUNDED_FULL) | PK id; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,sale_no); INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, session_id) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; financial-audit policy |
| SaleLine / `rtl_pos_sale_line` | sale_id uuid, product_ref uuid, variant_ref uuid?, qty numeric, unit_price_minor bigint, tax_minor bigint, discount_minor bigint, price_list_version text | PK id; CHECK qty>0; immutable price facts after payment; PARTIAL INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, updated_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL | INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL; policy retention |
| Tender / `rtl_pos_tender` | sale_id uuid, tender_type text, amount_minor bigint, external_payment_ref text?, state enum(PENDING,AUTHORIZED,CAPTURED,FAILED,REVERSED) | append-only where history/evidence; INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, sale_id, state) | FINANCIAL/CONFIDENTIAL; evidentiary retention |

Relationships are FK-constrained within the same tenant+industry context; cross-MS references store owning resource IDs and are resolved through service/projection contracts, never direct foreign-table reads. Ownership columns are immutable.

### Workflow / state machine
Canonical primary state: **OPEN_SESSION → DRAFT → TENDERING → PAID → RECEIPT → RECONCILED**.  
Invalid transition: any transition not in the MS transition table is rejected with `RTL-POS_STATE_INVALID`. Required transition facts: expected row version, actor, permission, reason where exceptional, correlation ID. Void/refund are governed reversal branches; sale line price/tax facts freeze at payment.

### Business rules / approvals
- **RTL-POS-R01** Price/tax resolve from active price list and freeze on line.
- **RTL-POS-R02** Refund above configured threshold requires approval.
- **RTL-POS-R03** Payment failure cannot create paid sale/stock issue.
- **RTL-POS-R04** Offline replay uses idempotency and current context; no duplicate stock/payment effect.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

### Permissions / ABAC
`rtl.pos.session.open` · `rtl.pos.sale.create` · `rtl.pos.sale.tender` · `rtl.pos.refund.request` · `rtl.pos.refund.approve` · `rtl.pos.session.reconcile`.  
ABAC dimensions: org unit/branch/site, resource ownership, workflow state, sensitivity, time/device where relevant. ABAC may restrict but never grant beyond RBAC. 

### Documents / notifications / reporting
Documents: receipt, refund/void record, reconciliation. All use DD-08 DocumentMeta.  
Notifications: payment/refund exceptions, variance; sensitive payloads use generic push preview.  
Reports/KPIs: sales, basket value, tender mix, refund/void rate; projections preserve Tenant+Industry ownership and exports require report/export permission.

### APIs / events / integrations
tRPC operations: `ind.rtl.pos.session_open` · `ind.rtl.pos.sale_create` · `ind.rtl.pos.sale_tender` · `ind.rtl.pos.refund_request` · `ind.rtl.pos.refund_approve`. REST only for real external integration. Inputs include resource ID/version and domain fields; outputs use DD-06 envelope; writes are idempotent where retryable.  
Events v1: `rtl.pos.session_open` · `rtl.pos.sale_create` · `rtl.pos.sale_tender`. Payloads include aggregate ID/state/version and minimal domain facts in DD-07 envelope.  
Integrations: PaymentPort, IWM stock, OMS returns; adapters use DD-06 IntegrationDefinition/ProviderAdapter and secret references.

### AI / experience / offline
AI: may suggest products/analyze basket; never alter price/tax or approve refund. RAG sources inherit ACL/sensitivity; tools bind the listed OperationContracts and acting-user permission; high-risk side effects require approval.  
Web routes: `/app/rtl/pos` list/detail/workflow/report views. Mobile: limited handheld POS if enabled. Desktop: primary POS candidate with printer/barcode.  
Offline class: **OFFLINE_OPERATIONAL_CRITICAL**. Sales may queue only with approved offline tender/stock policy; conflict financial/stock regulated, no LWW.

### Configuration / entitlement / dependencies / audit
Configuration: tenders, receipt format, refund threshold, offline capability. Security floors cannot be overridden.  
Entitlement: suite license + `RTL-POS` MS entitlement + module/feature entitlements; business services never hard-code plan names.  
Dependencies: RTL-RSM/IWM/OMS, Core Billing. Audit: every approval, state transition, financial/regulated correction, export and cross-module handoff records action/resource/state/reason/correlation.

### Tests / acceptance
Positive: session→sale→tender→receipt→reconcile. Negative: duplicate idempotency/payment or unauthorized refund denied. Isolation: wrong tenant and same-tenant wrong Industry Context must return no data/effect. Entitlement-disabled MS must deny. AI retrieval/tool uses same authorization. Unauthorized document/event consumer denied.  
**Acceptance:** offline/online sale produces exactly-once governed financial/stock outcomes.

| Reservation / `rtl_iwm_reservation` | order_ref uuid, product_ref uuid, qty numeric, state enum(HELD,COMMITTED,RELEASED,EXPIRED), expires_at timestamptz? | PK id; INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, order_ref, state); PARTIAL INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, state) WHERE state NOT IN ('CLOSED','CANCELLED','RETIRED','EXPIRED','REVOKED','COMPLETED') | INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL; policy retention |
| CycleCount / `rtl_iwm_cycle_count` | location_ref uuid, count_no text, state enum(PLANNED,COUNTING,REVIEW,APPROVED,POSTED), variance_json jsonb | append-only where history/evidence; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,count_no) | CONFIDENTIAL; evidentiary retention |

Relationships are FK-constrained within the same tenant+industry context; cross-MS references store owning resource IDs and are resolved through service/projection contracts, never direct foreign-table reads. Ownership columns are immutable.

### Workflow / state machine
Canonical primary state: **RECEIPT → PUTAWAY → AVAILABLE → RESERVED → PICKED → MOVED**.  
Invalid transition: any transition not in the MS transition table is rejected with `RTL-IWM_STATE_INVALID`. Required transition facts: expected row version, actor, permission, reason where exceptional, correlation ID. Counts use PLANNED→COUNTING→REVIEW→APPROVED→POSTED; reservations commit/release atomically.

### Business rules / approvals
- **RTL-IWM-R01** Order reservation atomically reduces availability; failure/timeout releases.
- **RTL-IWM-R02** Negative availability/stock prohibited.
- **RTL-IWM-R03** Adjustments require approval/reason.
- **RTL-IWM-R04** Cross-location transfer posts paired movements.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

### Permissions / ABAC
`rtl.iwm.stock.receive` · `rtl.iwm.stock.reserve` · `rtl.iwm.stock.pick` · `rtl.iwm.transfer.execute` · `rtl.iwm.count.approve` · `rtl.iwm.adjustment.post`.  
ABAC dimensions: org unit/branch/site, resource ownership, workflow state, sensitivity, time/device where relevant. ABAC may restrict but never grant beyond RBAC. 

### Documents / notifications / reporting
Documents: GRN, transfer, pick list, count sheet. All use DD-08 DocumentMeta.  
Notifications: low stock, variance, reservation expiry; sensitive payloads use generic push preview.  
Reports/KPIs: turnover, fill rate, inventory accuracy, stockout; projections preserve Tenant+Industry ownership and exports require report/export permission.

### APIs / events / integrations

Integrations: OMS/IWM, payment/accounting adapters; adapters use DD-06 IntegrationDefinition/ProviderAdapter and secret references.

### AI / experience / offline
AI: listing/support assistant may draft content; cannot approve KYC/settlement. RAG sources inherit ACL/sensitivity; tools bind the listed OperationContracts and acting-user permission; high-risk side effects require approval.  
Web routes: `/app/rtl/mkt` list/detail/workflow/report views. Mobile: seller portal/mobile. Desktop: none required.  
Offline class: **READ_OFFLINE**. Seller catalog may cache; KYC/order/settlement mutations online.

### Configuration / entitlement / dependencies / audit

## Fable 5 deterministic contract binding
The Retail MS sections above remain the canonical domain entity/module/permission/document/integration owners. The following remediation artifacts are **normative extensions of each listed MS**, not optional commentary:
- MS set: `RTL-RSM`, `RTL-POS`, `RTL-IWM`, `RTL-OMS`, `RTL-MKT`.
- Deterministic per-MS tests: `DD-21_MS_ACCEPTANCE_TEST_CONTRACTS.md` → `<MS>-T001…T014`.
- Exact major workflow transitions/forbidden edges/reversal-cancellation: `DD-22_MS_WORKFLOW_TRANSITION_MATRICES.md`.
- Behavior-bearing field/catalog and exact context-index rules: `DD-23_BEHAVIORAL_CATALOGS_INDEX_CONTRACTS.md` + `DD-23A_BEHAVIOR_FIELD_REGISTRY.md`.
- Domain-critical product defaults: `DD-24_INDUSTRY_DOMAIN_RULE_DECISIONS.md` → RTL-AC-001…004.
- Mathematical KPIs + KPI acceptance IDs: `DD-25_KPI_CALCULATION_CATALOG.md`.
- Requirement-ID chains: `Registers/DD_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY_F5.md`.
- 41-MS determinism evidence: `DD-27_41_MS_DETERMINISM_AUDIT.md`.

Where an earlier sentence in this file is less specific than a referenced remediation contract, the more specific remediation contract governs. None of these references permits cross-industry inheritance of business semantics.


## Canonical mobile-app mapping — Phase 3
All mobile capabilities in this Industry DD are routes/features inside the canonical `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and/or `TENANT_USER_APP` defined by DD-10/DD-11. Internal staff roles map to `TENANT_STAFF_APP`; external/customer/student/guest/citizen/donor/member/etc. roles map to `TENANT_USER_APP` where mobile scope exists. Role/persona labels never create separate mobile app classes or binaries. Platform Mobile is outside the Tenant app pair.
