# EDUCATION — MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DETAILED DESIGN
**Wave:** 3 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE

## EDU-SMS — School Management System
**Foundation owner:** F-13 §4.1 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · **Scope:** TENANT_INDUSTRY

**Purpose / actors / modules.** K-12 admission, student registry, classes/sections, attendance, timetable and promotion. Actors: School Admin, Principal, Admissions Officer, Teacher, Fee Clerk, Student, Parent. Modules: admissions; student registry; academic structure; timetable; attendance; promotion; notices.

### Entity design
All tables carry `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, `industry_context_id uuid NOT NULL`, `row_version bigint`, audit timestamps/actors, `is_demo boolean default false`; indexes start with tenant+industry.

| Entity / table | Domain fields (in addition to baseline) | Constraints / indexes | Sensitivity / retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student / `edu_sms_student` | student_no text, principal_id uuid?, admission_id uuid?, class_id uuid?, section_id uuid?, guardian_refs jsonb, status enum(APPLICANT,ENROLLED,ACTIVE,TRANSFERRED,GRADUATED,WITHDRAWN) | PK id; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,student_no); INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, status, updated_at) | SENSITIVE_PERSONAL; student-record policy |
| AdmissionApplication / `edu_sms_admission` | application_no text, applicant_name text, class_id uuid, source text?, state enum(ENQUIRY,APPLICATION,VERIFICATION,ASSESSMENT,OFFERED,WAITLISTED,ENROLLED,REJECTED,WITHDRAWN), submitted_at timestamptz | PK id; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,application_no); INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, class_id) | SENSITIVE_PERSONAL; student-record policy |
| ClassSection / `edu_sms_class_section` | session_id uuid, class_code text, section_code text, capacity int CHECK >0, homeroom_principal_id uuid?, status enum(ACTIVE,INACTIVE) | PK id; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,session_id,class_code,section_code); PARTIAL INDEX (tenant_id, industry_context_id, updated_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL | INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL; policy retention |
| AttendanceEntry / `edu_sms_attendance` | student_id uuid, attendance_date date, period_code text?, state enum(PRESENT,ABSENT,LATE,EXCUSED), marked_by uuid | append-only where history/evidence; UNIQUE (tenant_id, industry_context_id,student_id,attendance_date,period_code) | SENSITIVE_PERSONAL; evidentiary retention |

Relationships are FK-constrained within the same tenant+industry context; cross-MS references store owning resource IDs and are resolved through service/projection contracts, never direct foreign-table reads. Ownership columns are immutable.

### Workflow / state machine
Canonical primary state: **ENQUIRY → APPLICATION → VERIFICATION → ASSESSMENT → OFFERED → ENROLLED**.  
Invalid transition: any transition not in the MS transition table is rejected with `EDU-SMS_STATE_INVALID`. Required transition facts: expected row version, actor, permission, reason where exceptional, correlation ID. WAITLISTED, REJECTED and WITHDRAWN are explicit branches; enrollment requires capacity and required-document checks.

### Business rules / approvals
- **EDU-SMS-R01** Enrollment cannot exceed active class/section capacity; waitlist is offered.
- **EDU-SMS-R02** Attendance below configured threshold creates hold/alert; override requires authorized approval.
- **EDU-SMS-R03** Fee restrictions consume Core Billing policy and never delete academic records.
- **EDU-SMS-R04** Promotion/transfer certificate issuance requires finalized academic status.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

### Permissions / ABAC
`edu.sms.admission.view` · `edu.sms.admission.offer` · `edu.sms.admission.enroll` · `edu.sms.attendance.mark` · `edu.sms.promotion.approve` · `edu.sms.certificate.issue`.  
ABAC dimensions: org unit/branch/site, resource ownership, workflow state, sensitivity, time/device where relevant. ABAC may restrict but never grant beyond RBAC. 

### Documents / notifications / reporting
Documents: admission form, ID, transfer/leaving certificate, fee receipt references. All use DD-08 DocumentMeta.  
Notifications: admission offer/waitlist, attendance alert, fee reminder, promotion result; sensitive payloads use generic push preview.  
Reports/KPIs: enrollment, attendance %, fee realization, promotion rate; projections preserve Tenant+Industry ownership and exports require report/export permission.

### APIs / events / integrations
tRPC operations: `ind.edu.sms.admission_view` · `ind.edu.sms.admission_offer` · `ind.edu.sms.admission_enroll` · `ind.edu.sms.attendance_mark` · `ind.edu.sms.promotion_approve`. REST only for real external integration. Inputs include resource ID/version and domain fields; outputs use DD-06 envelope; writes are idempotent where retryable.  
Events v1: `edu.sms.admission_view` · `edu.sms.admission_offer` · `edu.sms.admission_enroll`. Payloads include aggregate ID/state/version and minimal domain facts in DD-07 envelope.  
Integrations: LMS/EMS service contracts; payment/communication through Core; adapters use DD-06 IntegrationDefinition/ProviderAdapter and secret references.

### AI / experience / offline
AI: Education assistant may explain status/summarize attendance and draft notices; cannot enroll/promote autonomously. RAG sources inherit ACL/sensitivity; tools bind the listed OperationContracts and acting-user permission; high-risk side effects require approval.  
Web routes: `/app/edu/sms` list/detail/workflow/report views. Mobile: teacher attendance + student/parent read views. Desktop: optional admin only.  
Offline class: **CONTROLLED_OFFLINE_MUTATION**. Attendance may queue with version/date validation; admissions/promotions stay online.

### Configuration / entitlement / dependencies / audit
Configuration: session, capacity, attendance threshold, promotion policy. Security floors cannot be overridden.  
Entitlement: suite license + `EDU-SMS` MS entitlement + module/feature entitlements; business services never hard-code plan names.  
Dependencies: EDU-LMS, EDU-EMS, Core Billing/Documents/Communication. Audit: every approval, state transition, financial/regulated correction, export and cross-module handoff records action/resource/state/reason/correlation.

### Tests / acceptance
Positive: application→enrollment→attendance→promotion. Negative: capacity overflow and unauthorized promotion rejected. Isolation: wrong tenant and same-tenant wrong Industry Context must return no data/effect. Entitlement-disabled MS must deny. AI retrieval/tool uses same authorization. Unauthorized document/event consumer denied.  
**Acceptance:** full lifecycle audited with certificates and context isolation.

- **EDU-CUM-R01** Program/course capacity enforced before registration.
- **EDU-CUM-R02** Attendance/eligibility policy can hold examination access.
- **EDU-CUM-R03** Progression is calculated only from finalized academic evidence.
- **EDU-CUM-R04** Financial restriction is consumed from Core Billing, not embedded.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

### Permissions / ABAC
`edu.cum.program.manage` · `edu.cum.enrollment.admit` · `edu.cum.term.register` · `edu.cum.attendance.mark` · `edu.cum.progress.finalize` · `edu.cum.record.view`.  
ABAC dimensions: org unit/branch/site, resource ownership, workflow state, sensitivity, time/device where relevant. ABAC may restrict but never grant beyond RBAC. 

### Documents / notifications / reporting
Documents: application, enrollment statement, academic statement, ID. All use DD-08 DocumentMeta.  
Notifications: admission, timetable, attendance, progression notices; sensitive payloads use generic push preview.  
Reports/KPIs: enrollment, retention, attendance, progression, completion; projections preserve Tenant+Industry ownership and exports require report/export permission.

### APIs / events / integrations
tRPC operations: `ind.edu.cum.program_manage` · `ind.edu.cum.enrollment_admit` · `ind.edu.cum.term_register` · `ind.edu.cum.attendance_mark` · `ind.edu.cum.progress_finalize`.

## EDU-EMS — Examination Management System
**Foundation owner:** F-13 §4.1 · **Status:** DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · **Scope:** TENANT_INDUSTRY

**Purpose / actors / modules.** Exam definition through controlled evaluation, moderation, publication and re-evaluation. Actors: Examination Controller, Faculty/Evaluator, Student, Admin. Modules: exam setup; eligibility; scheduling; hall tickets; evaluation; moderation; results; re-evaluation.

### Entity design
All tables carry `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, `industry_context_id uuid NOT NULL`, `row_version bigint`, audit timestamps/actors, `is_demo boolean default false`; indexes start with tenant+industry.

| Entity / table | Domain fields (in addition to baseline) | Constraints / indexes | Sensitivity / retention |

Relationships are FK-constrained within the same tenant+industry context; cross-MS references store owning resource IDs and are resolved through service/projection contracts, never direct foreign-table reads. Ownership columns are immutable.

### Workflow / state machine
Canonical primary state: **DRAFT → SCHEDULED → CONDUCTED → EVALUATING → MODERATION → APPROVED → PUBLISHED**.  
Invalid transition: any transition not in the MS transition table is rejected with `EDU-EMS_STATE_INVALID`. Required transition facts: expected row version, actor, permission, reason where exceptional, correlation ID. Re-evaluation creates a new evaluation/publication version; no published result is edited in place.

### Business rules / approvals
- **EDU-EMS-R01** Result publication requires Examination Controller approval.
- **EDU-EMS-R02** Attendance/eligibility hold prevents hall ticket unless approved override.
- **EDU-EMS-R03** Evaluator cannot silently overwrite submitted marks; corrections version.
- **EDU-EMS-R04** Published result is immutable; re-evaluation produces superseding version.
Approval-required actions use Core Workflow tasks; approver must still pass DD-03 in the same Tenant+Industry Context.

Integrations: SMS/CUM student registry, Core Documents/Communication; adapters use DD-06 IntegrationDefinition/ProviderAdapter and secret references.

### AI / experience / offline
AI: AI may assist anomaly/format checks and explain published results; never assign official marks autonomously. RAG sources inherit ACL/sensitivity; tools bind the listed OperationContracts and acting-user permission; high-risk side effects require approval.  
Web routes: `/app/edu/ems` list/detail/workflow/report views. Mobile: student schedule/result read; evaluator web/mobile optional. Desktop: optional exam office.  
Offline class: **ONLINE_ONLY**. Official evaluation/publication requires live authorization/current state.

### Configuration / entitlement / dependencies / audit

## Canonical mobile-app mapping — Phase 3
All mobile capabilities in this Industry DD are routes/features inside the canonical `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and/or `TENANT_USER_APP` defined by DD-10/DD-11. Internal staff roles map to `TENANT_STAFF_APP`; external/customer/student/guest/citizen/donor/member/etc. roles map to `TENANT_USER_APP` where mobile scope exists. Role/persona labels never create separate mobile app classes or binaries. Platform Mobile is outside the Tenant app pair.
