# DD-22 — MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM WORKFLOW TRANSITION MATRICES

## Governing transition rules
1. Only transitions explicitly listed in this artifact or a more-specific MS rule are allowed. Unlisted transitions return `<MS>_STATE_INVALID`.
2. Every transition requires immutable Tenant + Industry Context match, current `expectedVersion`, active entitlement and the listed workflow permission.
3. Any transition whose target is APPROVED, PUBLISHED, PAID, SETTLED, CLOSED, DISPOSED, ISSUED, FINALIZED, VERIFIED, RECONCILED, RELEASED or COMPLETED requires the configured domain approver when the underlying MS declares an approval role; otherwise the actor permission is sufficient. Approval evidence is explicit, never inferred from UI.
4. Cancellation is a named command, never direct status editing. If a workflow contains CANCELLED, cancellation is allowed only before a financially/legally/operationally irreversible terminal state and requires `<ms>.workflow.cancel`, reason code, expectedVersion and audit.
5. REVERSED is a compensating transaction/state. Original approved/posted/paid evidence is not deleted. Reversal requires `<ms>.workflow.reverse`, reason, linkage to original, compensating event and audit.
6. After APPROVED/PUBLISHED/SIGNED/FINAL/POSTED states, correction is version/addendum/reversal according to domain contract; backward mutation to DRAFT is forbidden unless an explicit REOPENED state/command exists.
7. Notifications use the MS notification policy; sensitive notifications contain safe preview only. If no recipient/notification is defined for a transition, value is `NONE`, not developer choice.

### Forbidden transition rules
- All unlisted edges are forbidden and return `SFM-FMM_STATE_INVALID` with zero domain mutation/event.
- Explicit examples: `CLOSED → OPEN`, `CLOSED → VERIFIED`.
- Direct database status edits are prohibited; only OperationContracts may transition state.

## SFM-FMM — PreventiveSchedule
States: `ACTIVE → PAUSED → RETIRED`

### Forbidden transition rules
- All unlisted edges are forbidden and return `SFM-FMM_STATE_INVALID` with zero domain mutation/event.
- Explicit examples: `RETIRED → ACTIVE`, `RETIRED → PAUSED`.
- Direct database status edits are prohibited; only OperationContracts may transition state.

## Coverage
- Stateful workflows/entities discovered from the nine canonical industry DD artifacts: **141**.
- Explicit allowed transition rows: **574**.
- All 41 MS namespaces are represented through their stateful entities; workflows without a state enum are governed by their operation/state contracts and DD-21 acceptance IDs.
